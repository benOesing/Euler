# Euler
Java implementations for the classical [project euler][euler] problems.

This Repository is separated into three blocks. The first contains the first 100 solutions, mostly written when I was learning Java. Those solutions are all bunched into one file, without comments and without following good standards.
The second block contains the same problems, solved like I would today in a professional context. Every solution has its own file, containing every necessary function to solve the given problem.\
The third block contains a library of common functions which both types of solutions heavely make use of.

The solution for any problem is not given in this repository to not spoil the fun. The code can be run and gives the correct solution.
