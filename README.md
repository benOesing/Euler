# Euler
Java implementations for the classical [project euler][euler] problems.

This Repository is separated into three blocks. The first contains the first 100 solutions, mostly written when I was learning Java. Those solutions are all bunched into one file, without comments and without following good standards.
Those solutions right now rely on a library in the background which can be found here: <b> [Comming soon][repository]</b>. A minimal working library is in the folder. Same quality applies.\
The second block contains the same problems, solved like I would today in a professional context. Every solution has its own file, containing every necessary function to solve the given problem.

# Disclaimer

The solution for any problem is not given in this repository to not spoil the fun. The code can be run and gives the correct solution.
